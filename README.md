A thread-safe, key-based lock management system for Rust that provides fine-grained concurrent access control.

## Features

- üîí Thread-safe key-based locking mechanism
- üöÄ High-performance concurrent implementation using `dashmap`
- üì¶ Support for both single-key and batch locking operations
- üõ°Ô∏è RAII-style lock guards for automatic lock release
- ‚ö° Zero-cost abstractions with minimal overhead
- üîß Configurable capacity and sharding for optimal performance

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
lock_manager = "0.1"
```

## Usage

### Single Key Locking

```rust
use batch_lock::LockManager;

// Create a new lock manager
let lock_manager = LockManager::<String>::new();

// Acquire a lock
let guard = lock_manager.lock("resource_1".to_string());

// Critical section - exclusive access guaranteed
// perform operations...

// Lock is automatically released when guard is dropped
```

### Batch Locking

```rust
use batch_lock::LockManager;
use std::collections::BTreeSet;

// Create a new lock manager with custom capacity
let lock_manager = LockManager::<String>::with_capacity(1000);

// Prepare multiple keys
let mut keys = BTreeSet::new();
keys.insert("resource_1".to_string());
keys.insert("resource_2".to_string());

// Acquire locks for all keys atomically
let guard = lock_manager.batch_lock(keys);

// Critical section - exclusive access to all keys guaranteed
// perform operations...

// All locks are automatically released when guard is dropped
```

### Custom Capacity and Sharding

```rust
use batch_lock::LockManager;

// Create a lock manager with custom capacity and shard count
let lock_manager = LockManager::<String>::with_capacity_and_shard_amount(
    1000,  // capacity
    16     // number of shards
);
```

## Performance Considerations

- Uses `dashmap` for efficient concurrent access
- Lock acquisition is fair and FIFO-ordered
- Batch locks are acquired in a consistent order to prevent deadlocks
- Memory usage scales with the number of active locks
- Sharding can be tuned for optimal performance based on workload

## Thread Safety

The `LockManager` is fully thread-safe and can be safely shared across threads:

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use batch_lock::LockManager;

let lock_manager = Arc::new(LockManager::<String>::new());
let lock_manager_clone = lock_manager.clone();

std::thread::spawn(move || {
    let guard = lock_manager_clone.lock("shared_resource".to_string());
    // Critical section
});
```
